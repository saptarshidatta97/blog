About me
Hi, I am Saptarshi Datta. I am working as a Business Intelligence(BI) Engineer specializing in ETL Data Integration at TATA Consultancy Services.

I have a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering and completed the Post Graduate Program in Business Analytics & Business Intelligence from UT Austin.

I am passionate about a lot of things and number crunching is one of them. Apart from this, I love to blog. In my free time, I like to relax a bit! :)
